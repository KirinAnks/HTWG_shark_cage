# Possible tasks for the first weeks

- create some sort of requirement visualisation (use cases maybe? - we can probably iterate on that)
- create testing environment (suitable for 2 people, lot of work - static code analysis,  virtual machines, compiler automation,...) 
- someone outlining basic architecture (class diagram? - dunno if we even want to mess aroud with the whole modeling thing)
- implementing first step (just creating safe desktop and switching into it)
